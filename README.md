## Description

Find your next adventure with TravelNow! Search the travel destination of your dreams to browse hotels, restaurants, and even things to do! Save any of these favorites to your favorites page. This is a full MERN application that also uses Auth0. The purpose of this project is to pull together everything that we have learned and create a complex application that truly showcases our newfound expertise. In the future, we would like to add a user based favorites page, the ability to create folders based on location in the favorites page, add links to the hotels for booking (since the API didn't supply this feature), and add routing to make certain pages available after logging in. 

## Installation

Please refer to our deployed [link](https://projecttravelnow.netlify.app/) to use this website without installing anything!

To run this application from your own computer, please be sure to clone the code from both the client-side and server-side repositories! Run "npm install" on both repositories to install all necessary dependancies. On the client repository, simply type "npm start" in your command line to start this React app. On the server side repository, simply type "node server" to connect to MongoDB and start the server. Once both are running, the app should run.

## Usage

This website is very user friendly. The home page displays the search bar allowing users to search for any city in the world. After searching, results are displayed and separated by category (hotels, restaurants, and points of interest). If the user is logged in they may add results to their favorites page.

The user does not need to log in to utilize the search function. However, using auth0, users can easily sign up using their Google accounts.

## Tests

There are no tests for this application.
